How This Project Was Built
This project was developed with a strong emphasis on modern web development practices using Next.js 15+ and TypeScript. Supabase is used for backend services, and API routes handle the logic for groups, expenses, and memberships. The design is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

AI Assistance and Productivity
I have to say, leveraging AI—specifically ChatGPT—was a major boost to my productivity during this project. Here’s a candid look at how AI became an integral part of my workflow:

Boilerplate Code on Demand:
Sometimes, I would write the initial structure of a file and then ask ChatGPT for a boilerplate snippet. This gave me a fast, working starting point that saved me hours of manually writing repetitive code. It was like having a virtual co-developer who could instantly provide the skeleton for new modules.

Rapid Adjustments and Debugging:
During development, I often ran into small errors or needed to tweak a particular piece of logic. Instead of scouring documentation for long periods, I would quickly describe the issue to ChatGPT. The AI offered immediate suggestions and adjustments, which I could test and iterate on. This not only sped up debugging but also kept the development flow smooth and uninterrupted.

Learning on the Fly:
There were instances when I wasn’t fully clear about a new concept or a method in Next.js or TypeScript. ChatGPT provided clear explanations and examples, helping me understand and integrate these concepts effectively. It served as a quick reference guide, making learning both accessible and enjoyable.

Hands-On Code Tweaks:
Although ChatGPT often gave me a strong starting point, its suggestions sometimes needed further tweaking to perfectly fit the context of my project. I reviewed and customized the AI-generated code to ensure it worked seamlessly within my codebase. This balance between automation and manual intervention enriched my coding experience and improved my skills.

Overall, using AI was a truly positive experience. It didn’t replace my own coding but rather complemented it by handling boilerplate, expediting fixes, and offering fresh perspectives on problems. The result was a more efficient development process and a project that I’m proud of.
